Charcoal Email
==============

Sending emails (with _PHPMailer_) and logging and queue management.


# How to install

The preferred (and only supported) way of installing _charcoal-email_ is with **composer**:

```shell
â˜… composer require locomotivemtl/charcoal-email
```

## Dependencies

-   [`PHP 5.6+`](http://php.net)
-   [`phpmailer/phpmailer`](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer)
-   [`locomotivemtl/charcoal-config`](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/charcoal-config)
-   [`locomotivemtl/charcoal-queue`](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/charcoal-queue)
-   [`locomotivemtl/charcoal-app`](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/charcoal-app)

## Optional dependencies

-   [`pimple/pimple`](http://pimple.sensiolabs.org/)
    -   Dependency injection Container (required for the [Service Provider](#service-provider))

> ðŸ‘‰ All optional depedencies are required for development. All other development dependencies, which are optional when using charcoal-email in a project, are described in the [Development](#development) section of this README file.

# Usage

A simple example:
```php
$email = $container['email'];
$email->setTo('recipient@example.com');
$email->setFrom('"Company inc." <company.inc@example.com>');
$email->setSubject("Email subject");
$email->setTemplateIdent('foo/email/simple-email');
$email->setTemplateData([
    'foo' => 'bar'
]);
$ret = $email->send();
```

Full example:

```php
$email = $container['email'];
$email->setData([
    'campaign'  => 'Campaign identifier'
    'to'    => [
        'recipient@example.com',
        '"Some guy" <someguy@example.com>',
        [
            'name'  => 'Other guy',
            'email' => 'otherguy@example.com'
        ]
    ],
    'bcc'   => 'shadow@example.com'
    'from'  => '"Company inc." <company.inc@example.com>',
    'replyTo' => [
        'name'  => 'Jack CEO',
        'email' => 'jack@example.com'
    ],
    'subject'       => $this->translator->trans('Email subject'),
    'templateIdent' => 'foo/email/default-email',
    'templateData'  => [
        'foo'   => 'bar'
    ],
    'attachments'   => [
        'foo/bar.pdf',
        'foo/baz.pdf'
    ]
]);
$email->send();

// Alternately, to send at a later date, use the queue system:
$email->queue('in 5 minutes');
```

# Email Config

The entire email system can be configured from the main app config, in the `email` config key.

```json
{
    "email": {
        "smtp": [
            "hostname": "smtp.example.com",
            "port": 25,
            "security": "tls",
            "username": "user@example.com",
            "password": "password",
        ],
        
        "defaultFrom": "webproject@example.com",
        "defaultReplyTo": "webproject@example.com",
        "defaultTrackEnabled": false,
        "defaultLogEnabled": true
    }
}

```

* Note that the `smtp` section is optional. By default, SMTP is disabled (local sendmail is used).

> It is recommended to use a single configuration file (ex: `config/email.json`) and include it in your main config.

# Service Provider

All email services can be quickly register to a (`pimple`) container with `\Charcoal\Email\ServiceProvider\EmailServiceProvider`.

**Provided services:**

| Service       | Type                | Description |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| **email**     | `Charcoal\Email\Email`        | An email object (factory). |
| **email/factory** | `Charcoal\Factory\FactoryInterface` | An email factory, to create email objects. |


Also available are the following helpers:

| Helper Service    | Type                | Description |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| **email/config**  | `Charocoal\Email\Config\EmailConfig` | Email configuration.
| **email/config/smtp** | `Charocoal\Email\Config\SmtpConfig` | SMTP configuration.
| **email/view**    | `Charcoal\View\ViewInterface`   | The view object to render email templates (`$container['view']`).
| **email/parser** | `Charcoal\Email\Service\EmailParser` | Helper to parse emails as RFC-822 strings or name/email array. |
| **email/sender** | `Charcoal\Email\Service\EmailSender` | Service that queues or actually sends the email. |
| **email/tracker** | `Charcoal\Email\Service\EmailTracker` | Service that logs and tracks sent emails. |


> ðŸ‘‰ For charcoal projects, simply add this provider to your config to enable:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "service_providers": {
>       "charcoal/email/service-provider/email": {}
>   }
> }
> ```

## Service dependencies

For the _email_ service provider to work properly, the following services are expected to e registerd on the same container:

-   `config`
-   `view`
-   `model/factory`

# Logging

By default, all emails sent through the Charcoal Email system are logged in the database. This function is provided by `\Charcoal\Email\Service\EmailTracker` via the `\Charcoal\Email\Object\EmailLog` object.

To disable logging for a specific email:

```php
$email->setLogEnabled(false);
```

# Development

To install the development environment:

```shell
â˜… composer install --prefer-source
```

To run the scripts (phplint, phpcs and phpunit):

```shell
â˜… composer test
```

## Development dependencies

-   `phpunit/phpunit`
-   `squizlabs/php_codesniffer`
-   `satooshi/php-coveralls`

## Coding Style

The Charcoal-Email module follows the Charcoal coding-style:

-   [_PSR-1_](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md)
-   [_PSR-2_](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)
-   [_PSR-4_](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md), autoloading is therefore provided by _Composer_.
-   [_phpDocumentor_](http://phpdoc.org/) comments.
-   Read the [phpcs.xml](phpcs.xml) file for all the details on code style.

> Coding style validation / enforcement can be performed with `composer phpcs`. An auto-fixer is also available with `composer phpcbf`.
